# üéØ Game Mode Selection - Learning Guide
## Understanding How to Implement Timed vs Infinite Mode

**User Story**: As a user, I want the ability to choose between different gameplay modes, so that I can play either in a timed mode or in an infinite mode according to my preference.

---

## üìã **Phase 1: Understanding the Requirements**

### **What You Need to Build:**
1. **Mode Selection UI** - Users choose between "Timed Mode" and "Infinite Mode"
2. **Separate Score Tracking** - Best scores for each mode independently
3. **Game-Specific Time Logic** - Each game calculates time differently
4. **Mode-Specific Gameplay** - Different rules for each mode

### **Key Concepts to Understand:**
- **State Management** - How to track which mode is selected
- **Data Persistence** - How to save separate scores for each mode
- **UI/UX Design** - How to present mode selection clearly
- **Game Logic Separation** - How to handle different rules per mode

## üèóÔ∏è **Phase 2: Data Model Design**

### **Step 1: Create Game Mode Enum**
**What to think about:**
- How will you represent the two modes in code?
- What should you call each mode?
- How will you pass this information between screens?

**Learning Questions:**
- What's the difference between an enum and a struct?
- Why use an enum instead of just strings?
- How will you make this enum work with your existing code?

### **Step 2: Design Score Storage**
**What to think about:**
- How will you store scores for each game + mode combination?
- What data structure makes sense for this?
- How will you save and load this data?

**Learning Questions:**
- Should you use UserDefaults, Core Data, or something else?
- How will you structure the data to be efficient?
- What happens when a user gets a new best score?

## üéÆ **Phase 3: UI/UX Design Strategy**

### **Step 1: Mode Selection Screen**
**What to think about:**
- Where should mode selection happen?
- How will users understand the difference between modes?
- What visual design will make the choice clear?

**Learning Questions:**
- Should this be a separate screen or integrated into existing screens?
- How will you explain what each mode does?
- What happens if a user doesn't make a selection?

### **Step 2: Visual Design**
**What to think about:**
- How will you visually distinguish between modes?
- What colors, icons, or text will help users understand?
- How will you show which mode is currently selected?

**Learning Questions:**
- Should you use different colors for each mode?
- How will you handle accessibility (screen readers, etc.)?
- What happens on different screen sizes?

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Phase 4: Implementation Strategy**

### **Step 1: Modify Setup Views**
**What to think about:**
- Which files need to be changed?
- How will you add mode selection to existing setup screens?
- What happens to existing functionality?

**Learning Questions:**
- Should you modify existing setup views or create new ones?
- How will you maintain backward compatibility?
- What's the best way to organize this code?

### **Step 2: Update Game Views**
**What to think about:**
- How will each game handle the selected mode?
- What changes are needed in game logic?
- How will you pass mode information to games?

**Learning Questions:**
- Should you modify existing game views or create mode-specific versions?
- How will you handle the different timer logic for each mode?
- What happens when a game ends in each mode?

### **Step 3: Score Management**
**What to think about:**
- How will you track scores for each mode separately?
- When and how will you save scores?
- How will you display best scores for each mode?

**Learning Questions:**
- Should you modify existing score storage or create new systems?
- How will you handle score updates efficiently?
- What happens if there's no previous score for a mode?

## üéØ **Phase 5: Game-Specific Implementation**

### **Memory Match Game**
**What to think about:**
- **Timed Mode**: How will you calculate time limits?
- **Infinite Mode**: How will you handle lives/continuing play?
- **Score Tracking**: How will scores differ between modes?

**Learning Questions:**
- Should time limits be based on number of pairs?
- How will infinite mode handle game continuation?
- What's a fair scoring system for each mode?

### **Sequence Recall Game**
**What to think about:**
- **Timed Mode**: How will you handle level progression?
- **Infinite Mode**: How will you handle mistakes?
- **Difficulty**: How will difficulty scale in each mode?

**Learning Questions:**
- Should timed mode have a maximum level?
- How will infinite mode handle life loss?
- What makes each mode challenging but fair?

### **Card Locator Game**
**What to think about:**
- **Timed Mode**: How will you handle the memorization phase?
- **Infinite Mode**: How will you handle wrong guesses?
- **Progression**: How will levels work in each mode?

**Learning Questions:**
- Should timed mode have fixed time limits?
- How will infinite mode handle continuous play?
- What's the best way to balance difficulty?

### **Speed Match Game**
**What to think about:**
- **Timed Mode**: How will you handle the time pressure?
- **Infinite Mode**: How will you handle mistakes?
- **Scoring**: How will scoring work in each mode?

**Learning Questions:**
- Should timed mode have a countdown or time limit?
- How will infinite mode handle life loss?
- What makes each mode engaging?

## üß™ **Phase 6: Testing Strategy**

### **What to Test:**
1. **Mode Selection** - Can users select and change modes?
2. **Score Tracking** - Are scores saved correctly for each mode?
3. **Game Logic** - Do games behave correctly in each mode?
4. **UI/UX** - Is the interface clear and intuitive?

### **Learning Questions:**
- How will you test that scores are separate?
- What edge cases should you consider?
- How will you verify the user experience?

---

## üöÄ **Phase 7: Implementation Order**

### **Recommended Steps:**
1. **Start with one game** (Memory Match is usually easiest)
2. **Create the data model** (GameMode enum and score storage)
3. **Build the UI** (Mode selection interface)
4. **Implement game logic** (Handle different modes)
5. **Add score tracking** (Save and display scores)
6. **Test thoroughly** (Verify everything works)
7. **Repeat for other games** (Apply the same pattern)

### **Learning Questions:**
- Why start with one game instead of all at once?
- What's the benefit of this incremental approach?
- How will you know when each step is complete?
