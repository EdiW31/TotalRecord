## Background and Motivation
> TotalRecard is an iOS app designed to help users improve memory through card-based games and the memory palace technique. The goal is to make memory training fun, challenging, and educational, while also deepening understanding of SwiftUI, game logic, and data persistence.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
> - Designing flexible, scalable game logic for multiple game types
> - Managing complex state and UI updates in SwiftUI
> - Implementing smooth, animated grid layouts for cards
> - Persisting user progress, scores, and palace data locally
> - Balancing usability, accessibility, and visual appeal
> - Introducing spatial learning concepts in an intuitive way
> - Ensuring code is testable and maintainable

## High-Level Task Breakdown
- [x] Task 1: Set up SwiftUI project structure and navigation
  - ✅ Success Criteria: App launches to a home screen with navigation to "Games" and "Memory Palace" sections.
  - 🎯 Learning Goal: Understand SwiftUI app structure, navigation stacks, and view composition.
  - 📘 Educator Notes: 
    - SwiftUI uses `@main` and `App` protocol for entry point.
    - Navigation is managed with `NavigationStack` or `NavigationView`.
    - Try creating a simple two-screen navigation example.
    - **Exercise:** Build a minimal app with a home screen and a button to a second view.
  - 🧑‍🏫 **Educator Summary:**
    - Both implementations used `TabView` for bottom navigation and split the app into three main sections: Home, Games, and Memory Palace.
    - The user's version correctly used separate views and navigation, with basic comments.
    - The AI version added more detailed comments, clearer placeholder text, and consistent layout with `VStack` for future expandability.
    - **Key Learning Points:**
      - `TabView` is the standard for bottom navigation in iOS apps.
      - Each `.tabItem` defines the icon and label for a tab.
      - Using separate views for each section keeps code organized and scalable.
      - Adding comments and clear placeholders helps future development and learning.
    - **Reflection:** Both approaches were correct; the AI version focused more on educational clarity and UI hints. You can mix and match these ideas as you continue building!

- [x] Task 2: Implement Memory Match (match-the-pairs) game logic and UI
  - ✅ Success Criteria: User can play a basic match-the-pairs game with cards flipping and matching.
  - 🎯 Learning Goal: Learn about state management, grid layouts, and user interaction in SwiftUI.
  - 📘 Educator Notes:
    - Use `@State` and `@StateObject` for reactive UI.
    - Grids can be built with `LazyVGrid`.
    - Card flip animations use `.rotation3DEffect`.
    - **Exercise:** Make a 2x2 grid of tappable cards that flip on tap.
  - 🧑‍🏫 **Educator Summary:**
    - **Comparison:**
      - Both versions implement a working Memory Match game with card flipping and matching logic.
      - The user's version uses a slightly larger deck and a straightforward approach to state and matching.
      - The AI version adds a processing lock to prevent double-taps during animation, uses a consistent background, and includes a flip animation with `.rotation3DEffect` for a more polished UI.
      - Both use `@State` for card state, and `LazyVGrid` for the grid layout.
    - **How it works:**
      - **State:** The `@State` variable `cards` holds the array of cards, each with properties for face-up and matched state. State changes trigger UI updates.
      - **Grid:** `LazyVGrid` arranges the cards in a flexible grid. The number of columns is set by the `columns` array.
      - **Flipping:** Tapping a card calls `flipCard(at:)`, which updates the state. If two cards are face up, the code checks for a match and either marks them as matched or flips them back after a delay.
      - **Animation:** The AI version uses `.rotation3DEffect` for a 3D flip effect, making the UI more engaging.
    - **Key Learning Points:**
      - Use `@State` to manage interactive UI state in SwiftUI.
      - `LazyVGrid` is ideal for grid-based layouts.
      - Use tap gestures and state updates to drive game logic.
      - Animations and UI polish can greatly improve user experience.
    - **Reflection:** Both solutions are valid; the AI version adds a few best practices for polish and user experience. You can combine ideas from both as you continue building!

- [ ] Task 3: Add scoring, timer, and difficulty settings to Memory Match
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Game tracks score, time, and allows difficulty selection.
  - 🎯 Learning Goal: Implement timers, scoring logic, and user settings.
  - 📘 Educator Notes:
    - Use `Timer.publish` and `.onReceive` for game timers.
    - Store scores in `@State` or `@ObservedObject`.
    - **Exercise:** Add a timer to a view and display elapsed time.

- [ ] Task 4: Implement Sequence Recall game mode
  - ✅ Success Criteria: User can view and repeat a sequence of cards, with increasing difficulty.
  - 🎯 Learning Goal: Manage dynamic sequences and validate user input.
  - 📘 Educator Notes:
    - Arrays and randomization for sequence generation.
    - Compare user input to stored sequence.
    - **Exercise:** Generate a random array and check if user input matches.

- [ ] Task 5: Implement Card Locator game mode
  - ✅ Success Criteria: User can remember and tap the location of hidden cards.
  - 🎯 Learning Goal: Use spatial layouts and tap detection.
  - 📘 Educator Notes:
    - Use `GeometryReader` for custom layouts.
    - Track card positions and user taps.
    - **Exercise:** Build a grid where tapping a cell reveals its content.

- [ ] Task 6: Implement Speed Match game mode
  - ✅ Success Criteria: User matches patterns quickly under a timer.
  - 🎯 Learning Goal: Handle fast-paced input and real-time feedback.
  - 📘 Educator Notes:
    - Use timers and state to manage fast rounds.
    - Provide immediate feedback on correct/incorrect matches.
    - **Exercise:** Create a button that must be tapped within a time limit.

- [ ] Task 7: Build Memory Palace creation and editing UI
  - ✅ Success Criteria: User can create, name, and edit palaces with rooms/locations.
  - 🎯 Learning Goal: Model hierarchical data and build forms in SwiftUI.
  - 📘 Educator Notes:
    - Use structs/classes for palace and room models.
    - Use `Form` and `List` for input and editing.
    - **Exercise:** Make a form to add/edit items in a list.

- [ ] Task 8: Implement card-location assignment and recall in palaces
  - ✅ Success Criteria: User can assign cards to locations and later recall them.
  - 🎯 Learning Goal: Build association logic and recall UI.
  - 📘 Educator Notes:
    - Use dictionaries or arrays for associations.
    - Design recall screens to test memory.
    - **Exercise:** Map items to locations and display them.

- [ ] Task 9: Add local persistence for scores, palaces, and assignments
  - ✅ Success Criteria: All user data persists between app launches.
  - 🎯 Learning Goal: Use SwiftData or UserDefaults for persistence.
  - 📘 Educator Notes:
    - Compare `UserDefaults`, `SwiftData`, and `CoreData`.
    - Save/load simple models.
    - **Exercise:** Store and retrieve a value using UserDefaults.

- [ ] Task 10: Polish UI with animations, accessibility, and responsive layouts
  - ✅ Success Criteria: App looks good on all devices, is accessible, and uses smooth animations.
  - 🎯 Learning Goal: Apply animation and accessibility best practices.
  - 📘 Educator Notes:
    - Use `.animation`, `.transition`, and `.accessibilityLabel`.
    - Test with different device previews.
    - **Exercise:** Animate a view's appearance/disappearance.

- [ ] Task 11: Add tests for scoring, timing, and sequence validation logic
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Key logic is covered by unit tests.
  - 🎯 Learning Goal: Write and run tests in Xcode.
  - 📘 Educator Notes:
    - Use `XCTest` for unit testing.
    - Test pure functions and logic.
    - **Exercise:** Write a test for a function that adds two numbers.
