# Task 7 Scratchpad: Build Memory Palace Creation and Editing UI

## Background and Motivation
The goal of Task 7 is to allow users to create, name, and edit memory palaces with rooms/locations. In your app, this means building on your existing `MemoryPalaceListView` and `PalaceModels.swift` to let users manage their own palaces. This feature is central to the memory palace technique, helping users organize and visualize information spatially. It will also serve as the foundation for later features, like assigning cards to locations (Task 8).

## How This Fits Into Your App
- You already have a `MemoryPalaceListView` that displays a list of sample palaces. Task 7 will turn this into a fully interactive view where users can add, edit, and delete their own palaces.
- Your data models (likely in `Models/PalaceModels.swift`) will be expanded to support editing and persistence.
- The UI will use SwiftUI’s `NavigationStack` for moving between the list, palace details, and room editing screens.
- This feature will connect with your other games by letting users later assign cards or information to specific palace locations (see Task 8).
- All changes should update the UI immediately, using `@State` or `@ObservedObject` as needed.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Modeling hierarchical data (palace > rooms/locations) in a way that works with SwiftUI’s state system
- Designing intuitive forms and lists in SwiftUI that match your app’s style
- Supporting add, edit, and delete operations for palaces and rooms, and making sure these changes are reflected in the UI
- Ensuring the UI is user-friendly and visually clear, consistent with your existing app

## High-Level Task Breakdown
- [x] Step 1: Design or update data models for Palace and Room/Location in `PalaceModels.swift`
- [x] Step 2: Update `MemoryPalaceListView` to show all user-created palaces
- [ ] Step 3: Implement a form to add a new palace (name, description, etc.)
- [ ] Step 4: Add navigation to view/edit a single palace and its rooms
- [ ] Step 5: Implement add/edit/delete for rooms/locations within a palace
- [ ] Step 6: Polish the UI for usability and clarity, matching your app’s look
- [ ] Step 7: (Optional) Add validation and error handling

## Success Criteria
- User can create, name, and edit multiple palaces in the app’s Memory Palace section
- Each palace can have multiple rooms/locations, which can be added, edited, or removed
- All changes are reflected immediately in the UI
- The interface is clear, easy to use, and fits with the rest of your app

## Learning Goals
- Practice modeling hierarchical data in Swift, using your own models
- Build forms and lists in SwiftUI, integrated with your app’s navigation
- Manage navigation and state for nested data (palace > rooms) using your project’s structure
- Apply best practices for user input and feedback in a real app context

## Step-by-Step Checklist
- [ ] Define or update Palace and Room structs/classes in `PalaceModels.swift`
- [ ] Build or update `MemoryPalaceListView` to show all palaces
- [ ] Add a button to create a new palace (shows a form)
- [ ] Implement a form view for adding/editing palaces
- [ ] Add navigation to a PalaceDetailView for each palace
- [ ] In PalaceDetailView, list all rooms/locations
- [ ] Add functionality to add/edit/delete rooms
- [ ] Test all flows for adding, editing, and deleting
- [ ] Review and polish UI to match your app

# Notes
- Use @State and @ObservedObject/@StateObject for reactive data
- Use NavigationStack and NavigationLink for navigation between list/detail/forms
- Use Form and List for input and display
- Keep UI simple and focus on functionality first
- This feature will connect to Task 8, where you’ll assign cards to palace locations
