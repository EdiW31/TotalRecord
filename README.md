# TotalRecard

TotalRecard is an iOS app designed to help users improve memory through card-based games and the memory palace technique. The goal is to make memory training fun, challenging, and educational, while also deepening understanding of SwiftUI, game logic, and data persistence.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Card-based memory games and the memory palace technique
- Fun, challenging, and progressively advanced gameplay
- Built with SwiftUI for iOS

## 🎮 Features
- **Memory Match** – Traditional match-the-pairs game
- **Sequence Recall** – View and repeat increasingly long card sequences
- **Card Locator** – Remember and tap the location of hidden cards
- **Speed Match** – Match patterns quickly under time constraints
- **Trophy Rooms** – Create virtual rooms, complete the achievements and review them later
- Game modes: Infinite/Timed for each game
- Timer-based gameplay (configurable)
- Infinite-based gameplay
- Progress tracking and local persistence
- Elegant SwiftUI UI with animations and accessibility

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- View and state management in SwiftUI
- Game loops and timer mechanics
- Dynamic grid layouts and transitions
- Data persistence using SwiftData or UserDefaults
- Applying design patterns for scalability
- Handling user input and animations
- Introducing spatial learning concepts programmatically

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Open `TotalRecord.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Build and run on the iOS Simulator or a real device.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `ContentView.swift` – Main entry point with TabView navigation
- `Games/` – All game modes (MemoryMatchView, SequenceRecallView, etc.)
- `MemoryPalace/` – Memory palace creation and recall views
- `Models/` – Data models for games and palaces
- `Assets.xcassets/` – App icons, images, and card assets
- `.cursor/scratchpad.md` – Project planning, learning notes, and task breakdown

## 📝 Development Approach
- Tasks are broken down in `.cursor/scratchpad.md` with success criteria and learning goals
- Test-driven and learning-focused development
- Modular, scalable SwiftUI architecture

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
- Inspired by classic memory games and the memory palace technique
- Built with SwiftUI and a focus on education and code clarity
